# crud-mongo-express

In this assignment, you will write an Express app that provides GET endpoints to perform CRUD operations against MongoDB. You will program the assignment using Mongoose. You will also add a middleware function to maintain and print certain statistics.

## Instructions

Write a web app that models a user as described below and provides the operations listed below.
User

Here are the properties of a User. 
Property 	Data Type 	Required?
name 	String 	Yes
age 	Number 	Yes
email 	String 	Yes
phoneNumber 	Number 	No
CRUD Operations

    These will be supported via GET requests.
    The request data will be provided as query parameters.
    The URLâ€™s must be /create, /retrieve, /update and /delete.

## Create

A user will be created by sending a GET request for the path /create.
Request Parameters for Create

Here are the query parameters for the request:
Name 	Always present? 	Notes
name 	Yes 	
age 	Yes 	
email 	Yes 	
phoneNumber 	No 	phoneNumber will only have the numeric characters 0 through 9, and will not contain any spaces, hyphens or non-numeric characters.
Response Body for Create

The response body will be JSON object for the document created in MongoDB.
Example

### Request:

http://localhost:3000/create?name=Cher Gray&age=27&email=cher@example.com&phoneNumber=8114482

Note: URLs containing certain special characters such as spaces need to be encoded. This is called percent-encoding or URL encoding and was discussed in Module 3 Exploration - HTML Forms. Most browsers do the encoding for you, so that you can type a URL with spaces in it and the browser does the necessary encoding when sending the HTTP request. But in case you use a tool for sending HTTP request that does not perform percent-encoding, be aware to this.

### Response:

Note that the property "_v" is a version number added by Mongoose. It is OK to include this property in the response. But this is your choice and you can also decide to exclude it from the response.

{  
  "phoneNumber": 8114482,  
  "_id": "60e435e0e2d67f620c534a84",  
  "name": "Cher Gray",  
  "age": 27,  
  "email": "cher@example.com",  
   "__v": 0 
}

## Retrieve

Users will be retrieved by sending a GET request for the path /retrieve.
Request Parameters for Retrieve

Here are the query parameters for the request:
Name 	Always present?
name 	No
age 	No
email 	No
phoneNumber 	No
_id 	No

A retrieve request can contain zero or more query parameters.

    If the request has no query parameters, then all the documents should be returned.
    If the request has one query parameter, then only the documents matching that query parameter should be returned.
    If the request has more than one query parameter, then only the documents that match every query parameter should be returned.
        In other words, when querying the database, all the values from the query parameters must be AND-ed together.

Response Body for Retrieve

An array of JSON objects corresponding to the documents matching the query parameters. The array will be empty if no document matches the query parameters.
### Example
Request:

http://localhost:3000/retrieve?_id=60e435e0e2d67f620c534a84

Response:

[  
  {  
   "phoneNumber": 8114482,
   "_id": "60e435e0e2d67f620c534a84",  
   "name": "Cher Gray",  
   "age": 27,
   "email": "cher@example.com",  
   "__v": 0  
  } 
]

## Update

A user will be updated by sending a GET request for the path /update.
Request Parameters for Update

Here are the query parameters for the request:
Name 	Always present?
name 	No
age 	No
email 	No
phoneNumber 	No
_id 	Yes

    Every request for /update will always contain _id as a request parameter.
        The _id of a document is immutable and cannot be changed.
    In addition to _id, a request will contain at least one other query parameter. However, a request may contain more than one query parameter.
        For example, a request may contain the query parameters _id, name, phoneNumber.
    The required behavior is that if any property is not specified in the query parameters, then the value of that property must not be updated.
        For example, if a request contains the query parameters _id, age, phoneNumber, the app must
            Find the document with this specified value of _id,
            Set the age property of the document to the value in the query parameter,
            Set the phoneNumber to the value in the query parameter, regardless of whether or not the document previously had a value for this property.
            Leave name and email properties of the document unmodified.

Response Body for Update

On success: A JSON object with the count of documents that have been updated. This value will be 1 whenever the update is successful.

{  "modifiedCount": 1 }

On failure: If no document exists with the specified value of _id, the response must contain the following JSON message:

{ "Error" : "Not found"}

### Example

Request:

http://localhost:3000/update?_id=60e435e0e2d67f620c534a84&age=28&phoneNumber=12193456

Response:

{  "modifiedCount": 1 }

## Delete

A user will be deleted by sending a GET request for the path /delete.

Here are the query parameters for the request:
Name 	Always present?
name 	No
age 	No
email 	No
phoneNumber 	No
_id 	No

A delete request will have exactly one of the above query parameters.

For example:

    If the request has the _id query parameter and there is a document with this _id value, it should be deleted.
    If the request has the name query parameter, you should delete all the documents in which the value of the name property is exactly the same as the value in the query parameter.
    Similarly, if the request has the query parameter email, age or phoneNumber, then all documents matching the value of email, age or phoneNumber must be removed.

Response Body for Delete

An JSON object specifying how many documents were deleted as shown below:

{ "deletedCount": 2}

If no documents were deleted, the response must be:

{ "deletedCount": 0}

### Example

Request:

http://localhost:3000/delete?age=27

Response:

{  "deletedCount": 3 }

## Middleware to Print Statistics

Write a middleware function that maintains statistics about retrieve requests and prints these statistics to the console.

    This middleware function must maintain a count of retrieve requests received from the time the server was started.
        In other words, keep the statistics in memory. Don't persist them to the database.
    The following statistics need to be maintained (you can choose to maintain any 2 of these 3 statistics, because the 3rd value can be computed from the other 2)
        Total retrieve requests
        Retrieve requests with 0 query parameters
        Retrieve requests with 1 or more query parameters
    The statistics must be printed to the console after the 10th retrieve request and then every 10 retrieve requests after that.
        i.e., after 10 retrieve requests are received, then after a total of 20 retrieve requests, then after 30, and so on.
    The maintenance and printing of the statistics must be done solely by this middleware function, and not by any of the app.get route handlers.

### Example: Printing Statistics

Total retrieve requests: 20
Retrieve requests with 0 query parameters: 12
Retrieve requests with 1 or more query parameters: 8

Separate Model Code from Controller Code

    Your model code must be separate from your controller code.
    Your model code can be in as many files as you want.
    Similarly, your controller code can be in as many files as you want.
    However, the model code and the controller code must be in separate files.
